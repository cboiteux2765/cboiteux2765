### Hi there 👋

- Pronouns: he/him
- I'm a current junior in high school interested in computer science, data science, and electrical/computer engineering.
- I primarily code in Java, C++, and Python.
- I'm currently looking into data science and machine learning, as well as some web development.
- I'm seeking to build a project to learn and improve software development skills (maybe seeking a collaborator?).
- Down for tutoring AP Computer Science A (got a 5)
